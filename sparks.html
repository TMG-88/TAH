        <h1>Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars</h1>
        <p>Original lyrics and music by Eban Schletter; lyrics by Ben Acker &amp; Ben Blacker  with musical arrangement by Andy Paley</p>
      </header>
      <p>When there's varmints need a' catching<br>
            And young 'uns need a' saving<br>
            On my rocket steed I race across the stars<br>
            For I've sworn by the burrs of my astro spurs<br>
            To right the outlaw wrongs on Mars<br>
            (Yes he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars!)</p>
      <p>Oh the hypercattle's humming<br>
            And the Marjun's savage drumming<br>
            Are as beautiful as comet bugs in jars<br>
            Oh I'm from Earth!<br>
            But I right the outlaw wrongs on Mars<br>
            (Yes he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars!)</p>
      <p>On the plains of the red planet I uphold the law<br>
            And I do it with a pair of robot fists<br>
            (POW!)<br>
            Evil extermination I have faced<br>
            For my robot rogues they hardly ever miss!<br>
            (Hardly ever miss!)</p>
      <p>And I reckon I'll be riding<br>
            In the name of truth and justice<br>
            For as long as I can count the shooting stars<br>
            For I've sworn by the burrs of my astro spurs<br>
            To right the outlaw wrongs on Mars<br>
            (Yes he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars!)</p>
      <p>And I'm from Earth!</p>

        <h1>Ride Along, Sparks Nevada</h1>
        <p>Lyrics and music by Eban Schletter, performed by Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins</p>
      </header>
      <p>By the light of the moon, and the other moon<br> 
      Out where the campfire's glare irradiates the air<br> 
      Let me hear the tune of the scarlet dunes<br> 
      And the Marshal who upholds what's right and fair</p>

      <p>Ride along, Sparks Nevada<br>
      May the gamma rays serenade your way<br> 
      Ride along, Sparks Nevada<br> 
      You'll return to Earth again someday</p>

      <p>Ride along, Sparks Nevada<br> 
      May the cosmic force of justice lead you on<br> 
      Ride along, Sparks Nevada<br> 
      The galaxy will echo with your song</p>

      <p>So sing me a song of the marshal who longs<br> 
      To fight the fight of righting wrongs<br> 
      Sparks Nevada, ride along!</p>

        <h1>Red Plains Rider</h1>
        <p>Lyrics and music by Ben Acker, Ben Blacker, and Andy Paley</p>
      </header>
      <p>Red as the sun<br>
         Her home is the hot desert sands<br>
         With her horse and her guns<br>
         She's searching the stars for her man</p>

      <p>If ever she seeks your hide<br>
         She won't rest until you die<br> 
         The wind dares to whisper her name!</p>

      <p>The Red Plains Rider!<br>
         The Red Plains Rider!<br>
         The Red Plains Rider!<br>
         YAH!</p>
