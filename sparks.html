      <p>When there's varmints need a' catching<br>
            And young 'uns need a' saving<br>
            On my rocket steed I race across the stars<br>
            For I've sworn by the burrs of my astro spurs<br>
            To right the outlaw wrongs on Mars<br>
            (Yes he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars!)</p>
      <p>Oh the hypercattle's humming<br>
            And the Marjun's savage drumming<br>
            Are as beautiful as comet bugs in jars<br>
            Oh I'm from Earth!<br>
            But I right the outlaw wrongs on Mars<br>
            (Yes he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars!)</p>
      <p>On the plains of the red planet I uphold the law<br>
            And I do it with a pair of robot fists<br>
            (POW!)<br>
            Evil extermination I have faced<br>
            For my robot rogues they hardly ever miss!<br>
            (Hardly ever miss!)</p>
      <p>And I reckon I'll be riding<br>
            In the name of truth and justice<br>
            For as long as I can count the shooting stars<br>
            For I've sworn by the burrs of my astro spurs<br>
            To right the outlaw wrongs on Mars<br>
            (Yes he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars!)</p>
      <p>And I'm from Earth!</p>

        <h1>Ride Along, Sparks Nevada</h1>
        <p>Lyrics and music by Eban Schletter, performed by Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins</p>
      </header>
      <p>By the light of the moon, and the other moon<br> 
      Out where the campfire's glare irradiates the air<br> 
      Let me hear the tune of the scarlet dunes<br> 
      And the Marshal who upholds what's right and fair</p>

      <p>Ride along, Sparks Nevada<br>
      May the gamma rays serenade your way<br> 
      Ride along, Sparks Nevada<br> 
      You'll return to Earth again someday</p>

      <p>Ride along, Sparks Nevada<br> 
      May the cosmic force of justice lead you on<br> 
      Ride along, Sparks Nevada<br> 
      The galaxy will echo with your song</p>

      <p>So sing me a song of the marshal who longs<br> 
      To fight the fight of righting wrongs<br> 
      Sparks Nevada, ride along!</p>

      </header>
      <p>Red as the sun<br>
         Her home is the hot desert sands<br>
         With her horse and her guns<br>
         She's searching the stars for her man</p>

      <p>If ever she seeks your hide<br>
         She won't rest until you die<br> 
         The wind dares to whisper her name!</p>

      <p>The Red Plains Rider!<br>
         The Red Plains Rider!<br>
         The Red Plains Rider!<br>
         YAH!</p>

        <h1>If You Love Something Never Set It Free</h1>
        <p>Written by Eban Schletter</p>
      </header>
      <p>If you love something, never set it free<br> 
      That way you can love that thing for all eternity<br> 
      If you're filled with affection, you've got to let it flow<br> 
      If you love something, never let it go</p>
      <p>I love pretty flowers with their beauty and their grace<br> 
      So I snip 'em off at the stem and stick 'em in a vase<br> 
      With just enough water to starve in a few days<br> 
      I love pretty flowers so I watch 'em wither away</p>
      <p>If you love something, never set it free<br>  
      That way you can love that thing for all eternity<br>  
      If you're filled with affection, you've got to let it flow<br> 
      If you love something, never let it go</p>
      <p>I love a doggie so I make him wear a collar<br> 
      I teach him tricks like stay and beg and where I go he fol'lers<br>  
      I make him fetch the paper and I'll own him to the grave<br>  
      I love a doggie and so he is my slave!</p>
      <p>If you love something, never set it free<br>  
      That way you can love that thing for all eternity<br>  
      If you're filled with affection, you've got to let it flow<br> 
      If you love something, never let it go</p>
      <p>I love chicken sandwiches, what do I do?<br>  
      I find me a chicken and I snap her neck in two<br>  
      I hack and stab and carve and cut her, throw her on a grill<br>  
      I love chicken sandwiches, and that is why I kill</p>
      <p>We love Sparks Nevada<br> 
      He's our favorite hero<br> 
      So his chance of leaving, has to remain zero<br> 
      We love singing cowboys<br> 
      Rid the world of strife<br> 
      That's why Sparks is gonna be<br> 
      Our prisoner for life</p>
      <p>If you love something, never set it free<br> 
      That way you can love that thing for all eternity<br>
      If you're filled with affection, you've got to let it flow<br> 
      If you love something, never let it go<br> 
      If you love something, never let it go!</p>
