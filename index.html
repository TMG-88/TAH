    <h2>Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars</h2>
    <p>Music &amp; lyrics by Eban Schletter</p>
    <p>When there's varmints need a' catching<br>
And young 'uns need a' saving<br>
On my rocket steed I race across the stars<br>
For I've sworn by the burrs of my astro spurs<br>
to right the outlaw wrongs on Mars<br>
(Yes he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars!)</p>
<p>Oh the hypercattle's humming<br>
And the Marjun's savage drumming<br>
Are as beautiful as comet bugs in jars<br>
Oh I'm from Earth!<br>
But I right the outlaw wrongs on Mars<br>
(Yes he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars!)</p>
<p>On the plains of the red planet I uphold the law<br>
And I do it with a pair of robot fists<br>
(POW!)<br>
Evil extermination I have faced<br>
For my robot rogues they hardly ever miss!<br>
(Hardly ever miss!)</p>
<p>And I reckon I'll be riding<br>
In the name of truth and justice<br>
For as long as I can count the shooting stars<br>
For I've sworn by the burrs of my astro spurs<br>
To right the outlaw wrongs on Mars<br>
(Yes he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars!)</p>
<p>And I'm from Earth!</p>
