      <p>When there's varmints need a' catching<br>
            And young 'uns need a' saving<br>
            On my rocket steed I race across the stars<br>
            For I've sworn by the burrs of my astro spurs<br>
            To right the outlaw wrongs on Mars<br>
            (Yes he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars!)</p>
      <p>Oh the hypercattle's humming<br>
            And the Marjun's savage drumming<br>
            Are as beautiful as comet bugs in jars<br>
            Oh I'm from Earth!<br>
            But I right the outlaw wrongs on Mars<br>
            (Yes he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars!)</p>
      <p>On the plains of the red planet I uphold the law<br>
            And I do it with a pair of robot fists<br>
            (POW!)<br>
            Evil extermination I have faced<br>
            For my robot rogues they hardly ever miss!<br>
            (Hardly ever miss!)</p>
      <p>And I reckon I'll be riding<br>
            In the name of truth and justice<br>
            For as long as I can count the shooting stars<br>
            For I've sworn by the burrs of my astro spurs<br>
            To right the outlaw wrongs on Mars<br>
            (Yes he rights the outlaw wrongs on Mars!)</p>
      <p>And I'm from Earth!</p>
